## Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm a PhD student in Biology at Duke University, and I'm excited to share my research journey with you.

## What You'll Find Here

This website serves as a platform to share my research and academic work in biological sciences. You can explore my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jBOe1ocAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lianzijun-Wang).

## About This Site

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, with the beautiful [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. The site features:

- Clean, responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Full-text search
- Tag and category organization

## Code Example

Here's a quick example showcasing the syntax highlighting:

```python
def analyze_data():
    """
    A simple demonstration of code highlighting
    """
    print("Hello, Research!")

    # Example: Processing sample data
    samples = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    results = [x * 2 + 1 for x in samples]

    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    output = analyze_data()
    print(f"Results: {output}")
```
