## Abstract

UNC-52/perlecan, a basement membrane proteoglycan, is crucial for muscle cell attachment in *C. elegans*. The protein contains two RGD motifs in domains III and IV, known for integrin binding. Two mutations were created—RGE substitution and RGD deletion. The RGE mutation caused abnormal actin filaments and mislocalized β-integrin PAT-3 and talin TLN-1. Deletion of the motif produced a Pat (paralyzed at two-fold embryo) phenotype similar to pat-3 nulls. These findings indicate the RGD motif is an essential, conserved integrin-binding ligand required for development and survival.
