## Abstract

The amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) is a cell-binding motif for extracellular matrix proteins. Initially found in fibronectin, the RGD motif is also found in LAM-3/laminin α chain in *C. elegans*. Laminin, a heterotrimeric glycoprotein, is a major component of the basement membrane. Mutations in laminin subunits disrupt the extracellular matrix and inhibit cell adhesion. This study characterizes the RGD motif in lam-3/laminin α. Two mutations, lam-3 RGE and lam-3 ΔRGD, were generated. The mutants revealed that the RGD motif participates in motility regulation, indicating that cell-laminin interaction contributes to body contraction control.
