## Abstract

TLN-1/talin is a conserved focal adhesion protein linking integrin to actin. In *C. elegans*, TLN-1 is expressed in muscles and gonadal sheath cells. A CRISPR-generated TLN-1(W387A) allele, predicted to alter integrin binding, caused mild motility and ovulation defects but no major actin structural changes. These results indicate that residue W387 in TLN-1 has limited impact on integrin binding and muscle organization *in vivo*.
